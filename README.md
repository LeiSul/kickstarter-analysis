Final Project Analysis

Project overview

How the Launch date can produce success or failure

   Our findings reflect a greater success rate in the summer months, ranging from April to August
with the highest success showing 100% or more in both May and June. In the same data set of the Outcomes
based on Launch date we find only one month under a 50% success rate which is December. We can possibly
conclude the summer months provide a more comfortable environment for attending, where as the inclimate 
weather may keep patrons from braving the elements of either driving or walking to see a play.

How outcomes are affected by the Goal

   The most glaring piece of information we gained from this analysis was that plays either fail or succeed, we 
did not see any canceled plays. The two highest points of success reflected are two different price points, under 
$5,000 and $35,000 - $45,000. The failure rate was more conclusive showing the lowest percentage of failure under
$5,000 and the highest percentage of failure over $45,000. To help secure a succcesfull outcome it would be beneficial
to keep the goal under $5,000.

Additional information 

 It could be valuable to run a comparison of goal amounts, pledged amounts and number of backers based on successful 
 or failed outcomes. This overall view could provide more insight into items that could promote success.
